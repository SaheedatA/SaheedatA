Hey there üëãüèº, 
I am Saheedat, a BI/Data Analyst working together with businesses in making smarter decisions to increase revenue and profits, and to boost business growth. 

I transform raw data into valuable insights and actionable information to help maximize business efficiency. With my concise data visualisations and captivating storytelling techniques, I work with business owners and managers to gain insights to make smarter and sustainable data-driven decisions. 

Whether it's your sales performance, customers satisfaction, employee performance, or your marketing analytics, and inventory and supply chain, I can help you increase revenue and profits by efficiently utilizing analytical softwares to extract actionable information from your data.

I am skilled in Excel, Tableau, PowerBI and SQl in interpreting, analysing and visualising data. I leverage on my transferable skills in philosophy and critical thinking in identifying trends and patterns, to conduct critical analysis and deliver valuable insights. 

When I am not playing with data, I am making sustainable impacts in the Nigerian social innovation space through my initiative, where I lead my team to deliver sustainable solutions to period poverty in Nigeria, by increasing access to reusable menstrual hygiene products and educational materials for women and girls. 

I enjoy working with businesses to deliver sustainable impacts and high returns on business investments, and I am open to work.
